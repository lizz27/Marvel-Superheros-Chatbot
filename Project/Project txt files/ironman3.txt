Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography.    
It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies.    Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass. 
For what? Did I miss something?
Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose.
What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid.    I'm sorry, kid, you did good.
Yep    Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?
 I can tell. You know how I can tell? Cus we're connected. 
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy- 
You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?
It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?
Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.
And password, please.
It's not the '80s, nobody says "hack" any more. Give me your login. 
 That is so much better than "lron Patriot."
That ain't gonna cut it.
Shh.
Shh. Keep it down.
No, he's not.
Come on in. Close the door.    Shh...
Yep.
Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?
Great. What's your name?
Gary?
Right there is fine.
Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay.
What do you want?
It's fine.
Right.
A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me? 
Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.
All right? It's a mission.
Tony needs Gary.
Be quiet about it. Go.
 A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you, pal.
Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.
How much have you had?
Can you still see straight?
That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?
What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.
Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?
What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...    Oh, God, not again.
Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.
 God, what am I gonna do?
Right.
Yes, I did.
Okay. Thanks, kid.          
Hey! 
Don't move.
What?
Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
What do you mean?
It is?
Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit. 
What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?
You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.
Then how did you get here, Trevor?
Next?
What did they say? They'd get you off them?
Did you just nod off? Hey. 
"He"? Killian?
He created you?
Custom-made terror threat.
Your performance? Where people died?
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under... 
Ah...    Okay. 
Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.
Okay. So you took Killian's card.
And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.
Yeah.
Yeah? 
 I'm telling you it isn't.    I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Did I do that?
I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?
I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.
You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.
You're something else.
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
What's next for you in your world?
You are a maniac.
 Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?
Very nice.
Break it, you bought it.
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.
You'll see.
Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two...
All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!
You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.
Here it comes. Three, four...
 Five, four, three, two, one!    Told you. Where's the rest?    Where's the rest?      
Ah! Better late than never.    Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.
Ah! Let's go!    Aw, crap.
Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.
Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
 The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
What have you come as?
 never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.
eah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.
ere's how it works, Meryl Streep.
Spill.
What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.
Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?
So?
Right.    Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.
Sir, this is Tony Stark.
We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
And what about the suit I'm wearing?
That's going to have to do.
The President. Now.
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.    How many in the air?
How many can I carry?
Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather? 
Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?
I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do.
Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice.
Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!
He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello. 
Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper...    That came out of nowhere. Wow 
I think they all made it.
Yeah, but I missed the president.
Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?
Correct.
I hope not.
Viking funeral. Public execution.
Yep. What do I do?
Six, high, back. Alright.    You see that? Nailed it.
You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance. 
I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.
Give me one of yours.
You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?
Too fast. Nothing. Here we go.    Three guys, one girl, all armed.
You're right. We need backup.
You know what? 
Yep.
Yeah.    Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice.
What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.
Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.    
Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you?    Nice timing.
Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.
I got you covered.
About time. 
See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.    Come on. A little more, baby.    
Yeah, you take a minute.    Jarvis, give me a suit right now!    Oh, come on!
Nice work.
Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No! 
Eject. 
I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns.    Whatever.
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect.    Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.
I got nothing.    Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me?    Honey?
You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...
It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.
Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here.
Don't worry about it.
No, you're not. Not hot.
No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff.
Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.
You know what to do.
Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes.    Okay, so far? Do you like it?
To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle.    And the fact that you've been able to -help me process...    Are you with me?
Are you actively napping?
Where did I lose you?
So, you heard none of it?
So?
What? The time?
You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.
