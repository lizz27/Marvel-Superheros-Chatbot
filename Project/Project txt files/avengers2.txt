''"' Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said "language?"
Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion.
I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?
Great, I wanna poke it with something.    Drawbridge is down, people.
And for gosh sake, watch your language! 
Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through.    It was a good talk.
Sentry mode.    Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.
I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.
 Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...    Yay!    
Yeah, I got... something bigger.    Thor, I got eyes on the prize. 
Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?
Thanks.    Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.
JARVIS, take the wheel.
 It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...
Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?    I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying right?
Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?
 Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.
Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.
He's fine. He's thirsty.    Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's play time. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.
So there's elements you can.
Like a reactor?
Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?
 Here's your beverage.
Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.
Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside-- You may recognize, 
Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.
Top of the line.
Meet the competition. 
If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?
Um-um.
Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but... I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.
This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.
Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.
Our job is "if." What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.
As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?
I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.
Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.
I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.    What did we miss?
Thanks, buddy.
I always do. 
Peace in our time. 
No.
Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.
And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.
Come on.
Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. 
Smell the silent judgment?
Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.
It's physics.
Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?
I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta.    I'll be right back.    
Are you on my team?
Alright, let's go! 
Let's go, Steve, no pressure.
And?
All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.
The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. "Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation?
JARVIS.
 Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.
One sec, one sec I got this!
Come on! That's the one!
Yes there was. 
 Come on. Use your words, buddy.
No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so... is it so... it is. It's so terrible.
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.
Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.
We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
Saved New York?
Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's... that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?
We'll lose.
What's this?
And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.
Not everything. 
Wait. I know that guy.    From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms.    There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything.    He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very "Ahab."
Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...
If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...
 The strongest metal on earth.
Ahh, Junior.    You're gonna break your old man's heart.
He beat me by one second.
This was never my life.
Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?
And you're not going anywhere.
News or footage, keyword: Hulk.    Natasha, I could really use a lullaby. 
I'm calling in VERONICA.    Alright everybody, stand down!    You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner. 
Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner.    Okay.    In the back? Dick move, Banner.    VERONICA, gimme a hand.    Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!    Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.    No, not that way, not that way!    Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me!    Everybody out! Going to get ugly!    I'm sorry.    Damage report.    That's comprehensive. Show me something.    How quickly can we buy this building?    
Stark Relief Foundation?
Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.
So, run and hide?
Neither do we.    Hey, you wanna switch out?
A few hours from where?
A safe house?
 This is an agent of some kind.
 These are...smaller agents.
Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?
Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.
Seems like you walked away all right.
I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?
Banner and I were doing research.
That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the "why" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?
Yeah, I'll give her a kick.    Don't take from my pile.    Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you? 
Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?
Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?
You're not the director of me.
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.
I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.
I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.
He still going after launch codes?
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.
By whom?
I might need to visit Oslo, find our "unknown."
Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.
Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.
He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.
She's all yours, apparently. 
A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.
Pretty simple. You bring a magnet.    Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me. 
Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.
Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?
Yeah, about that. 
You have to trust me.
Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. 
Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.
No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing.    We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.
JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.
I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand.    It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.
This framework is not compatible.
How about "nonce"?
Nope, not gonna happen.
That's nothing compared to what's coming!
I'm rerouting the upload.
We... reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.
What's he waiting for?
No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.
I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
I don't know, how much time you got?
Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?
FRIDAY! The Vision?
FRIDAY?
If it drops?
Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! 
Cap, you got incoming.
The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...
Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.
Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.
Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.
Yep. If you live to tell it.
We get through this, I'll hold your own.
I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.
Thor, I got a plan!
Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
Avengers, time to work for a living.
Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing "hide the zucchini."
 This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose. 
Well, like the old man said. Together. 
We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!
Re-route everything. We get one shot at this. 
Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.
You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.
Thor, on my mark.    Now! 
We're dealing with something new.
A machine.
No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.
Nice guy, but artificial.
It would still go up.
Well, not if you don't leave.
Triple Yahtzee?
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears. 
Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.
You'll get there one day.
You alright?
