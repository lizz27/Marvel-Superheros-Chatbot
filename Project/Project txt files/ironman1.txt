''"' Thanks.
JARVIS, you up?
I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two.
Actually, I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?
I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.
Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy.
Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We're gonna start off nice and easy. We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one. 
Up two. All right, set that.
Yeah, everything's... What? 
Great!
Great. I'll be right up.
It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.    I didn't expect that.    How'd it go? It went that bad, huh?
Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all...
This was a board of directors meeting?
A what?
Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen.
It doesn't matter. We own the controlling interest in the company.
I'm being responsible! That's a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great. 
I'll be in the shop.
No. No, absolutely not.
This one stays with me. That's it, Obie. Forget it.
Thank you.
Good night, Obie. 
 Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. All right, nice and easy. Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three, two, one.    Okay. Please don't follow me around with it, either, 'cause I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down! If something happens, then come in. And again, let's bring it up to 2.5. Three, two, one.    Okay, this is where I don't want to be! Not the car, not the car! Table! Could be worse! Could be worse! We're fine! Okay.    No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Yeah, I can fly.
JARVIS, are you there?
Engage heads-up display.
Import all preferences from home interface.
All right, what do you say?
Can we start the virtual walk-around?
Do a check on control surfaces
Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control.
JARVIS! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one.    Handles like a dream. All right, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?
Records are made to be broken! Come on! 
Keep going! Higher!    We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice! 
Kill power. 
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude. Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.
Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?
Thrill me.
JARVIS, we get an invite for that?
A little ostentatious, don't you think?
Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.
Don't wait up for me, honey.
Sure don't. You look great, Hef.
What's the world coming to when a guy's got to crash his own party?
I'll see you inside.
You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute. Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the..
God, you need a new name for that.
Let's just put something on the books.
Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right. Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you.
Just avoiding government agents.
Yes. Where'd you get that dress?
That's great.
Well, I got great taste.
You want to dance?
All right, come on.
Am I making you uncomfortable?
You look great and you smell great.
But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
I'd make it a week. Sure.
Five.
Right.
The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?
Totally harmless.
We're dancing. No one's even watching.
I think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced.
I don't think it was taken that way.
I just think you're overstating it.
Got it, okay.
Okay.
Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?
Oh, hey.
Carrie.
Carrie.
That's right.
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.
Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you.
I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear.
When were these taken?
I didn't approve any shipment.
Well, I'm not my company.
Have you seen these pictures? What's going on in Gulmira?
You know what? I was naive before, when they said, "Here's the line. We don't cross it. This is how we do business." If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?
He's all yours.
Hello?
Who's this?
Sorry, hello?
Speak up, please.
Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
It's funny how that works, huh?
Well, that's a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?
I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.
Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.
Nope!
That's my exit.
Hit it.
Flares!
Deploy flaps!
Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
I'm sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me.
This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Hey, thanks.
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?
Hey!
Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to...
Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.
Same drill. They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them. I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them.
There is nothing except this. There's no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else.
You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?
I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.
 Good boy.
Where's Pepper?
That's not going to be enough.
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.
Keep the skies clear.
How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?
Keep me posted. Pepper!
I'm fine. How are...
I know. Listen, you'd better get out of there.
Get out of there right now!
Stane!
Put them down!
Divert power to chest RT.
Lady! No, no, no, no, no, no!
Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.
I know the math! Do it!
Climb!
Keep going!
Just leave it on the screen! Stop telling me!
How'd you solve the icing problem?
Might want to look into it.
Woah! Potts!
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.
Weapons status?
Flares!
Potts?
This isn't working. We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.
You're going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know. You're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here.
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time. This looks important! 
Pepper!
Time to hit the button!
Just do it!
Push it!
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.
Okay?
Yeah.
See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island.
All right.
There's nothing about Stane here.
But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard? He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?
You know, it's actually not that bad. Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.
 Am so.
 All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night.
You know.
Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.
Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public. 
Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man.
Jarvis!
Who the hell are you?
 Ah.
