''"' This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.
Candice.
Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?
At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.
I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.
That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.
It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . .    Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.
Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? "To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges." Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.
No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now.
Go break some eggs.
Restroom's this way, yeah?
It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
Are you going up?
Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
Boy, you know me so well.
Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.
That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. 
There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.
Who said we're giving up?
That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.
If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?
No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.
 No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
 Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
Warmer than jail.
Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely.    FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.
See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?
We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .
No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference.    In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.
Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.
I know, because you're a very polite person.
No, you don't.
Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.
Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .
She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.
What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
She's not a US citizen.
And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.
Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.
Thank you, sir.    My left arm is numb, is that normal?
Always.    36 hours, jeez.
Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
No.
Me too. Where's yours?
Oh, Mr. Parker.
Tony.
It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?
Right?
The September Foundation.
Yeah. Remember when you applied?
I approved, so now we're in business.
That's what I'm here to hash out.
It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's pretty well funded.
Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
 As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.    Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?
You're a dumpster diver.
Ah-ah! Me first.
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.    That's you, right?
Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills.
Mm-Hmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?
Oh, what have we here?
So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
Not in that onesie, you're not.
Who else knows? Anybody?
Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?
Lordy! Can you even see in these?
You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here.    Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?
Mm-Hmm.
Sure, because you're different.
 So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?
 I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.    You got a passport?
You ever been to Germany?
Oh, you'll love it.
Why?
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
Alright, Spider-Man.    Get me out of this.
Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?
Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?
Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos!    Nice job, kid.
Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.
Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . .
. . . Good job.
And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.
Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite.    Come on.
Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?
What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
 Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?
First time for everything.
Yeah, I detected that too.
Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?
Neither are we. 
 Friday?
They what?
Who's speaking?
Friday?
Give me back my Rhodey. 
Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.
Maybe the kid's on to something.
 Kid, you alright?
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
Yeah.
Yeah. You're done. Alright?
You did a good job. Stay down.
Stay down.
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
Rhodey! 
RHODES!    Read vitals.
How did this happen?
I didn't think that was possible.
The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
You let them go, Nat.
'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.
 What am I looking at, Friday?
Fire up the chopper.
Did you run facial recognition yet?
Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.
Must be.
So, what happened to the real Broussard?
Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.
Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .
Because you broke the law.
I didn't make you.
You read it, you broke it.
Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side? 
Who are you?
They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. What do you need? They feed you yet?
I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.
 Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes.    Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.
Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…
Easy.
Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink. 
You seem a little defensive.
At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.
Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
You too, Cap.    Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . . 
I got heat signatures.
Uh, one.
I'm betting I could beat that.
 I know that road. What is this?
 Did you know?
Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?
Move!
Ah crap.
Come on, come on.
I'm eyeballing it.    Do you even remember them?
I don't care. He killed my mom.
Analyse his fight pattern.
 Let's kick his ass. 
So was I.    Stay down. Final warning.
That shield doesn't belong to you.    You don't deserve it. My father made that shield! 
It's just the first pass.
Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
You okay?
Yeah, put him through.
Ah, please hold.
