''"'    Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.
 My private elevator...
 Was steaming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?
 I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
 Call your mom, can you bunk over?
 You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
 Then leave it urgently.    Security breach.    That's on you.
 Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.
 Which is why he can't stay.
 I don't like being handed things.
 Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
 The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify.
 Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others.
 Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? 
 You know, I thought we were having a moment.
 How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
 This is, uh...    This.
 Tomorrow.
 Well, what if I didn't?
 Yeah.
 Square deal. It's the last date.
 What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
 Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?
 It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, during your time as a Capsicle.
 Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.
 Then don't take my stuff.
 Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?
 He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist.
 Okay.
 How about that?
 It's a stabilizing agent.    I'll fly you there. Keep the love alive. Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.
 Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.
 Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?
 Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.
 Finally, someone who speaks English.
 Shall we play, doctor?
 If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.
    You know, you should come by STARK TOWER sometime. Top ten floors, all R&amp;D. You'd love it, it's candy land.
 Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises.
 Nothing?
 You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
 Funny things are.
 You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut.
 You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
 He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets.    It's bugging him too, isn't it?
 That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
 I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.
 Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.    Blueberry?
 An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible.
 Following is not really my style.
    Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?
 That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
 What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit. It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does.
 Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
 You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.    This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege.
 Because I learned how.
 Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.
    I guess we'll find out.
 You just might.
 Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
 And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.    What is PHASE 2?
 I'm sorry, Nick.
 What were you lying?
 Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down.
 Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is this now about me?
    You're on that list? Are you above or below angry bees?
 Threatening! I feel threatened!
    Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?
    Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.
 Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
 I think I would just cut the wire.
    A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle!
 Got it.
 I can get there faster.
 You gonna stop me?
 I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
 Yep!
 Find engine three. I'll meet you there.
 Good. See what we got.
 I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.
 Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push.
 Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag…
 See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word.
 Cap, I need the lever!
 Lever. Now!
 No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.
 He was an idiot.
 For taking on Loki alone.
 He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have…
    Right. How did that work for him?
    WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife!
    He made it personal.
 That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?
 He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience.
 Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered…    Sonofabitch!
 Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
 Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.
 Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you.
 Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?
 No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one.
 THE AVENGERS.    It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES' type of thing.
    Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demigod; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
 Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
 We have a HULK.
 You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.
 Well, performance issues. You know? Not uncommon. One out of five…
 Jarvis. Anytime now.
 Right. Army.
 Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
 I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
 Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot.
 Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.
 Nice call. What else you got?
 And he didn't invite me?
 I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute.
 And I know just where to put it.
 What the hell?
 What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me.
 Alright, hey...
 Alright. Good job, guys.
 Let's just not come in tomorrow...let's just...take a day.
 Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.
 And then shawarma after.
