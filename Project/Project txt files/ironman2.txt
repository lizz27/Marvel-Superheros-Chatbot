''"' He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.
 Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.
 What?
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?
 No, I’m not good.
 Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.
 Yeah.
    Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.
 I think I got it, yeah.
 I don’t have any dough. Here. 
 No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine
 Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great.
 Sometimes.
 Relax.
 Is here.
 I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.
 Mute.
    I’ll get this stuff out of here.
    Will I?
 I would like to be. Got a minute?
 Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds.
 I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not.
 Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…
 Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it.
 Yes.
 Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
 I need you too.
 That’s what I’m trying to…
 I’m good, Hap.
 I lost both the kids in the divorce.    Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?
 It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?
 Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?
 Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?
 You’re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.
 Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.
    How many buildings are there?
 That was rhetorical. Just show me.    What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
 I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees.    Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad.    Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. 
 Thank Dad.
 Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode.
 Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?
 Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?
 That’s it. Bring that to me.
    It’s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And… Drop it. Drop it.    Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?
 Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
 Secret stuff?
 Bye. Thanks. 
 Yeah, more than you know.
 That was easy. 
 Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…
 My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?
 You what?
 You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
    Trace him.
 Jarvis, where is he?
 Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.
 You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now.
 I don’t want to hear it Jarvis.    That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!
 We got trouble.
 Give them a wave.
 All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
 Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko.
 What is he?
 Where’s Vanko?
 Tell me.
    Is that you?
    Let’s take it outside. 
 Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
 On what?
 How are we doing Jarvis?
 Nice work kid. 
 Let’s get this away from the Expo.
 Got it.
 Rhodey, you still locked on?
 Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.
 I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What’s your 20?
 Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
 Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you.
 Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore. 
 I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.
 You didn’t let me.
 I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
 Great. Pepper?
 I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…
 …when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
 We could have been in Venice.
 Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up.
    You okay?
 Don’t be.
 I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.
 Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?
 Got you. Where do you want to be?
 What’re you talking about?
 You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.
 No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.
 Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.
 Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?
 See that?
 Rhodey? Get down.    
 Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.
 With the what?    Hammer tech?
 I got this.    Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?
 I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.
 Yep.
 Take it! 
 Pepper? 
 You can’t?
 Look at me.
 I think I did okay. 
 What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses.
 You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.
 Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.
 You’ve taken such good care of me. I’ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so… Right?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up.
 Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…
 I know.
 Weird.
 It’s okay, right?
 Run that by me again. 
 Yeah, so we’re not…
 You should get lost.
 I thought you were out of one-liners.
 You kicked ass back there, by the way.
 Not okay. Not okay with that.
 How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?
 “Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it.
 “Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship. 
    You can’t afford me.    Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.
